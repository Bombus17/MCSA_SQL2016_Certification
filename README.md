## MCSA Database Developer (SQL 2016)
This repository holds working scripts and summary notes I created when studying for the following exams:
* Querying Data with Transact-SQL (70-761)
* Developing SQL Databases (70-762)

### Notes
* Scripts have been split based on the exam syllabus
* Scripts are written in SSMS 18.2
* Each section builds on the last
* Have attempted to answer real world questions rather than provide a list of mutually exclusive queries. 
* All code is commented to provide further information and context.
* Sample databases: https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples

### Requirements
Scripts are written in SSMS 18.2. To run these scripts locally:
1. Install the AdventureWorks2017 sample database
2. Install the WideWorldImporters sample database
